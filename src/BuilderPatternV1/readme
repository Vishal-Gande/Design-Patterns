This is version v1

This gives a basic understanding of how to use builder pattern

We create two classes - Student : the production env, and builder: the staging env

We do all the validation etc in builder class, and initialise the builder object... Once everything is ready, we use builder
object to create a Student object.

Problems with this approach:
- Client will have to read extra documentation of builder class to create student class object. Ideally, reading student
class docs should suffice to create a student object. In the next version, let's implement that.
