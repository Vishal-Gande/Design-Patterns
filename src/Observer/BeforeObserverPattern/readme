Flipkart's code without Observer Design pattern

Issues:

a) Tight coupling between classes Flipkart and services  --> Violates Dependency inversion
b) To add a new service tomorrow, you will need to edit Flipkart's code --> OCP violation
c) Scalability issues .. if new services get added, flipkart's constructor overloaded w parameters


Let's solve for these issues with the help of Observer Design Pattern.
