This is "Practical Factory Design" - this is the most used design pattern.
If someone says, implement factory DP --> mostly he/she means implement Practical Factory DP

When to use?

- Creation of objects based on user input(or some condition)


Without PF DP, we wud simply have those switch cases or if-else conditions
inside the """CLIENT""" class itself each time whenever(could be a 100 places)
we're creating classes based on some condition.
Issues with this approach:
a) You have to add if-else conditions at each block
b) Tomorrow if new class gets introduced, you will have to change existing
    client code --> violates OCP
c) You may forget to update client code whenever new classes get added


How are we solving for above issues?  --> Practical Factory!
Create a new dedicated class just for object creation, name it BirdFactory
Have all the logic to create objects based on user input.
