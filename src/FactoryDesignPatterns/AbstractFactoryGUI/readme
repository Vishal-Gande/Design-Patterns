Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern and is considered
as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern.

Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.

This is AbstractFactory for GUI components

UI components --> Button, checkbox, Menu are interfaces..

Actual classes --> WindowsButton, MacButton implement them

Factory related : (Responsible for creation of classes)
GUI Factory: Has all required component creation methods --> createButton(),createCheckbox(), createMenu()
Windows/MAC Factory implement GUI Factory
