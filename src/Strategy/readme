Strategy Design Pattern

When to use?

Whenever there are multiple ways to perform a behaviour, instead of coding the behaviour in the
entity itself, create separate classes for each type of that behaviour

Eg: Find path/route behaviour in G-Maps might have multiple implementations based on Mode of transport
namely bike_route, car_route etc.. Create separate classes for each of them, and make them implement a
common interface

In this code,

we have "PathCalculator" interface which all modes of transport - bike, car etc classes implement
Additionally, we have added a PathCalculatorFactory class to create correct class based on user input
depicting Practical design pattern
